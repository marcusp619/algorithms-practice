* Frequency Counters
- This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
+ Thic can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(N^2) operations with arrays/strings
*/

/*
  Write a fn called same, which accepts two arrays.
  The fn should return true if every value in the array has 
  its correspond value squared in the 2nd array. 
  The frequency of values must be the same
